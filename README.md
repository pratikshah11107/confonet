1.1 PROJECT DEFINITION 

             Confonet Web Application website is being running all over INDIA and it is running in two levels District Forum & State Forum but we are developing this System only for District Forum this System is used by Consumer Forum i.e. if any consumer have any type of problem than he/she can case on the opponent party than he/she will go to consumer forum.
                         In older time this all process is being done manually but afterwards computer is used and this website is being developed so that the work can be done easily and the time will be less consumed.
                       All over INDIA only one website is being running but we are developing this website for District Forum because there are some errors in this current System which is running, so we are developing this System by keeping in mind all the bugs.

1.2 PURPOSE
Purpose of the software product is as follows:
• To render speedy justice to the consumers with better legal output to bring about transparency and uniformity in the judicial system.
• To reduce the workload of the staff of the consumer fora considerably
• To enhance efficiency and result in expeditious disposal of pending cases.
• To process voluminous data with increased speed without losing accuracy thus resulting in greater litigant satisfaction.






1.3 SCOPE OF THE SYSTEM

                                        In the CONSUMER FORUM., the case entries is done manually, with this system the record entries is done automatically with computerized method and also stores description in the database.

The scope of the whole system is as follows:
	Record case entries at different levels they are as follows:

Filing: - under which fresh cases are filed.
Dealing Assistance: - under which all case details are entered, then only the cases will appear in courtroom.
Court Room: - under which all court room related process are listed.
Member: - under which searching and cause list are listed.
Record Room: - under which unrecorded cases are recorded.
Report: - under which all the reports have been listed.
Administrator: - under which all administrators related tasks have been listed.

	Master database for above mentioned entries for container.
	Generation of reports.

The interfaces, the system can provide are:
Reports are based on the final decision taken of the particular case like Pendingcase Report, Judgment Report etc

1.4	OBJECTIVE

Main Objectives of the System       

	Transparency among the courts, court system and consumer.
	Automation of recording new case entries.
	Modification of existing records & case entries.
	Automation of notice generation.
	Automation of report generation.
	Automation of Pendingcase Recording.
	Automation of securing system.
	Time efficient Record search through various queries in the application software.


Other objectives of the system are as under   

	The system should reduce data entry error to have proper integrity constraints and validations.
	The system should have various validations and it will give proper error message which will give the directions to the user about what should be done to enter the data correctly.
	Facility of taking backup database.
	Reduction of manual work.


1.5	PROJECT DURATION

Our project duration starts from 1-2-2010 to 30-4-2010.

1.6 TECHNOLOGY

	ASP.NET
       
ASP.NET is a platform that excels in the authority of Web application development. It also can be used in stand-alone applications. ASP.NET produces HTML content—some static and unchanging, some dynamic and changeable.
Asp.net 2.0 supports some brilliant new features that enable faster development of web applications with lesser code. The new features have made the developer’s life a lot easier.
A web directive to achieve consistent layout among web pages. But, with the new master page concept of ASP.NET 2.0, a Web developer just needs to define the layout once and for all. All the other web pages follow this template web page layout and the only thing that needs to be done is the insertion of page specific content. This way a lot of time and effort of a developer is saved. 
For the most part, here won’t distinguish between the features that are new in Asp.net 2.0 and those that have existed since Asp.net 1.0 However, in the next few sections you’ll tour some of the highlights.
ASP.NET is the next generation of server-side web technology. When written correctly, it is considerably different from its predecessor, ASP. In fact, you can’t even code ASP.NET using ASP’s default language, VBScript, because VBScript is no longer supported. 
ASP.NET programs are now compiled like any other program before they move to production, thus giving a major speed boost to the old interpreted ASP. To call an ASP.NET program in a browser, you use a file ending in .aspx instead of.asp. There is still support for the old ASP files, but files ending with .asp are run through a different interpreter when requested by a user. 
ASP.NET programs are written in standard languages such as Visual Basic (VB), managed C++, or the new C#. All ASP.NET program in the book will be written in C#, but they could have just as easily been written in VB or managed C++.
 A very powerful feature of ASP.NET that is used extensively throughout this book is the code behind feature. This feature allows for the complete separation of HTML and logic code into different files, thus letting HTML experts and software developers specialize in what they do best.
State can now be maintained without any special coding on the part of the developer between form submittals because all the logic to handle this automatically generated when the ASP.NET program is compiled.
Validations are now very simple to do because ASP.NET will generate the appropriate client-side JavaScript to handle the validation on the client machine and will also validate for correctness on the server-side. This is just in case hackers try to cause problem by overriding the generated JavaScript.

	SQL  SERVER  2005 

Many features of ASP.NET rely on intrinsic application services such as membership, roles, profiles, and personalization. The application services use providers, objects that persist application service data in long-term storage. For example, the ASP.NET personalization service uses a personalization provider to save personalized user settings on Web pages.
ASP.NET includes features that enable you to add data access to your ASP.NET Web pages with little or no code. You can connect to databases, XML data and files, and business objects as data sources. You can then display data using a variety of controls that provide great flexibility in how you present data on the page.
Each application service uses one provider to persist the service's data in a particular kind of data store. For each service, a SQL provider is included and configured as the default provider to persist the data in a Microsoft SQL Server database. 

 SQL SERVER .NET data provider: This is the optimal choice for SQL Server or greater. This provider uses the Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol, which is SQL Server's native data format. The TDS protocol operates by sending data packets over Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), and it is the fastest performing provider. To use this provider, you need to import the System.Data.SqlClient namespace into the .NET application.
